# "160 awesome, ridiculous, and downright creepy Gboard emoji combos you should try out"

*09-06-2021 21:11* 

> Of all the new devices, apps, services, and features we saw in 2020, one of my favorite and most used has been the ability to combine two emojis in Gboard
Of all the new devices, apps, services, and [features we saw in 2020](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/30/our-10-favorite-android-features-from-2020/), one of my favorite and most used has been the ability to [combine two emojis in Gboard](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/10/16/gboard-adds-a-bunch-of-hilarious-and-disturbing-emoji-mash-up-stickers-apk-download/) to create a totally new mashup sticker that embodies both. And I'm not alone. My Android Police colleague Taylor loves them just as much, as do many of our readers. There are [thousands of possibilities](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/03/android-gets-14000-new-emoji-combinations-ai-generated-audiobooks-and-more/) and the choices are quite overwhelming, but we've spent enough time trying out many of the combos and discovering the results, from cutesy to disturbing, and feel it's time we shared with you our favorites.

This post is best viewed on a device that supports all of the newest emojis. If you're checking it on your desktop and see some blank squares, switch to your phone. Anything running Android 10 and above should be able to display most of these properly.

## How to use Gboard's Emoji Kitchen

[Emoji Kitchen](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/03/27/gboard-test-sticker-suggestion-from-existing-emoji/) is a feature of Google's first-party keyboard on Android only. To use it, you need to download and install [Gboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin), then open it and set it as the default keyboard on your phone. In Gboard's settings, you should also make sure that *Preferences > Emoji browsing suggestions* is enabled. This is what ensures that the feature is turned on.

Now, head over to a compatible app (list below) and type two emojis. A strip should show up on top of the keyboard and below the text field with a few large suggested emoji stickers. The first one on the left is a combination of the last two emojis you typed; in the example below, it's the winking face with a hand covering its mouth in one slightly naughty combo.

***Left****: "Emoji browsing suggestions" should be enabled**.* ***Right****: Sticker bar above the keyboard.*

### Compatible apps

These emoji combos don't work everywhere on your phone. Some apps support them, but the majority don't. As a general rule, the ones that do are those that already support stickers (because the combo is actually a sticker). We've verified that the feature works in these apps, but odds are it's also compatible with plenty of other text messaging and social network ones:

-   Google Messages
-   WhatsApp
-   Telegram
-   Twitter
-   Instagram
-   Facebook Messenger
-   Signal
-   TextNow
-   LinkedIn

### All the supported emojis (220+)

It probably takes Google's designers a lot of time to come up with each design, especially the ones that aren't a straightforward mash-up of two emojis but a more thoughtful combo (pig + fire = bacon, snowman + fire = melted snowman, etc...), so it's understandable that the combos aren't available for all emojis. We've listed all the ones that can be mashed up with themselves or with another emoji below, but keep in mind that some may be a bit limited. The 100 points or ribbon, for example, are pretty limited in what they can be combined with.

Most notably missing among these are any hand gestures and all the human and activity emojis, so you can't combine a thumbs-up, shrug, doctor, or football with something else. Flags aren't supported either, and the number of compatible emojis in the food, objects, and symbols categories is very limited.

And yes, I'll repeat this until someone at Google hears me: WHERE IS THE DOG?! How come we get lots of animal combos but no dog?! I'm honestly livid. This is unacceptable. And don't try to tell me it's an unintended oversight, this is an evil plan hatched and executed to perfection by all the kittens at Google.

### Our favorites 'modifiers'

Given the breadth of options available, I wanted to highlight what I'll call our favorite 'modifiers.' These are the emojis that work really well with most others and often yield good or interesting results. Just try them with another face reaction or animal and see for yourself.

For example, you can make anything into a ghost, robot, alien, pumpkin, skull, or cyclops. You can put any emoji in a hole, a snowglobe, on a platter, or make it the top event on a newspaper. The upside-down face turns any emoji around, the masked face adds a mask to anything, and the shooting star makes any emoji dizzy. Fire, tree, tornado, balloon, and cake modify all emojis in a funky way. The turtle is adorable with anything. And let's not forget the hot dog and poop emojis, they're pretty much ridiculous with anything you add to them.

## 60 best emoji intensification combos

*\*rubs hands\**

Ah, we get to the fun part now. First, let's start with the mash-ups made by intensifying the same emoji, i.e. inserting it twice. The results are overall awesome (even if predictable at times), but we're going to focus on some of the most special combos.

### Ridiculously funny

## 100 best distinct emoji combos

Things get even more interesting when you step out of the simple path of combining the same emoji twice and start mashing up different ones together. For example you can give any expression to any animal (as long as they're supported by the feature), mix different colored hearts with various emojis for unexpected effects (try them with the birthday cake, cupcake, or sunglasses, to name a few), make a tornado out of anything, and way, way, way more. There's not enough time in the world to try them all, but we'll share with you here the ones we've discovered and loved.
