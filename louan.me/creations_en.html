                        <p class="imgDesc">Twitter is a platform that favors the creativity and the developement among its users. They provide an API that allows us to make robots (bot) capable of automatically do any action the user can do. I had the idea to use this API as well as other technologies to create a Twitter bot that, at regular intervals, selects two random emojis and tries to find the best way to merge them, so that it creates a new, exclusive, emoji. The project acquired 100 000 followers within the first week.<br/><br/>Technologies used : <strong>Twitter API, Processing and node.js</strong></p>

I had to write an article of several pages on a subject of my choice, by respecting some writing rules. Then, it was requested to make the layout around it, as a double-page with a cover and a fake advertisement that has something to do with the theme choosen.
                            <br/>My article is about the new innovative project of Google : The Google City.
